<h3> About Me </h3>
<p> Recently I realized that one “business of life” can not be limited, so I decided on global changes. For 7 years I have studied my past direction from and to, so now I want to scale my successes in other areas. Ready for full immersion in processes, projects and team. From me, involvement, dedication, control, development of myself and colleagues, and much more.
I think that front-end development is the most suitable business for revealing my talents.</p>
